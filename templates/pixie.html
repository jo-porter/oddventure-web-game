<div class="description">
		<p>You travel through the shaft which ends high above a walled garden. You 
		drop from the opening, carefully cushioning your landing on a bush below. 
		You see a single door, bolted and padlocked. A pixy sits cross legged in 
		the centre of the garden, meditating...or sleeping, you can't really 
		tell. Do you tap her on the shoulder or whisper in her ear?<p>
