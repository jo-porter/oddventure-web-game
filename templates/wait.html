	<p>	And so you wait. You wait for a reality destined never to become. For a 
		truth that will never be. You wait for an eternity, knowing the futility 
		of your endeavour, but comforted by the fact that you recognise the 
		futility, whilst those around you continue their lives in the absurd 
		certainty that they have meaning and purpose. You wait.</p>
