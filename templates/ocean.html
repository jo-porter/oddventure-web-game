	<p>You step through the door and fall down into a water slide. It carries 
		you for miles before spitting you out into the middle of the Atlantic 
		Ocean (I know, I know. Don't overthink it). Just when it appears all is 
		lost, a blue whale appears in front of you and offers to carry you safely 
		back to shore. She has just one condition: to make sure you're not one of 
		these environment trashing douchebags who goes around poluting her home 
		and killing her loved ones, she needs you to answer a question. Ok? </p>
