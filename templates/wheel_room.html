		OK you head through the tunnel, gagging at the rancid smell and
		desperately trying to avoid the rusty, jagged metal protruding from the
		walls. You reach a grate at the far end. It takes multiple kicks to
		break it down, but finally it flies off and you climb down into a large
		room.</p>

	<p>	In it you find three doors and a spinning wheel divided into thirds.
		Next to it, a message reads:</p>

		Life is a game of chance, the throw of a dice from another's hand.
		To believe yourself master of your own universe is madness itself. 
		Yet still we persist, and so shall you....Spin the wheel my child.
