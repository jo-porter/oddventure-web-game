# oddventure-web-game

Web app version of previous command line text game. Written in Python with Web.py.

Front end is HTML and CSS, and still very much a work in progress, but the game itself should mostly work.

To play: 

Clone the repo, add a /sessions folder and within oddventure-web-game folder run python bin/app.py and go to localhost:8080/game to begin.
